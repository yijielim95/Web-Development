    <p>I started my first table tennis training when I was 9 years old. After a year, my coach decided to let me represent his table tennis club, and I started my table tennis career. As we can see, I have started my table tennis career for 10 years (I'm 19 now). In these 10 years, I have won some medals, and I will list down some of the prices that I won from 2017 until 2022. It is because I didn't record all awards in Microsoft Words in my whole career.

   <h2>Things that I inspired by Table Tennis</h2>
<p>This is a quote that I always tell myself when I lose a competition:</p>
    <blockquote class="navy" cite="https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fpulse%2Fquotes-wise-outlandish-characters-kungfu-panda-change-huda-shabbir&psig=AOvVaw1GqwIU_C6JEdXJ5XwrvhSQ&ust=1697657529327000&source=images&cd=vfe&opi=89978449&ved=0CA8QjRxqFwoTCJCH07Dp_YEDFQAAAAAdAAAAABAL">"Yesterday is a history, tomorrow is a mystery, but today is a gift, that is why it's called the present." ~ Master Oogway.</blockquote> 
<p><strong>Thanks for the character in <em>KungFu Panda Master Oogway</em> who always inspired me in everything. </strong></p>
